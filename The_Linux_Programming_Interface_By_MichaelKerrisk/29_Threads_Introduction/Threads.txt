POSIX Threads (Pthreads)
__________________________________________________________________

#include <pthread.h>

// Thread creation
int phthread_create(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr, 
            void*(*start)(void*), void *arg);

    // Returns 0 on success, or a positive error number on error

// Thread termination
void pthread_exit(void* retval);

pthread_t pthread_self(void);
    // Returns thread ID of calling thread

int pthread_equal(pthread_t t1, pthread_t t2);
    // returns nonzero value if t1 and t2 are equal, otherwise 0

int pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void** retval);
    // Returns 0 on success, or a positive number on error

int pthread_detach(pthread_t thread);
    // Returns 0 on success, or a positive number on error

Thread versus Processes
Advantages of thread:
    - Sharing data between thread is easy. By contrast, sharing data between
    processes requires more work.
    - Thread creation is faster than process creation. context-switch time
    may be lower for threads than for processes.
Disadvantage of thread:
    - When programming with thread, we need to esure that the functions we
    called are thread-safe manner.
    - A bug in one thread can damage all of the threads in the process, since
    they share the same address space and other attributes. In contrast, processes
    are more isolated from one another.

    - Dealing with signals in multihtreaded application requires careful design.
    It is usually desirable to avvoid signals in multihtreaded program.
    - In a multithreaded application, all threads must be running the same
    program. In multiprocesses application, different processes can run different
    programs.

Every process has a set of associated numeric user identifiers (UIDs) an dGroup identifiers (GIDs).

UID -> User identifiers
GID -> Group identifiers

-Real User ID and Group ID
-Effective user ID and group ID
-Saved set-user-ID and saved set-group-ID
-File-system user ID and group ID
-Supplementary group IDs

*Real User ID and Real Group ID*
----------------------------------
Identifies user and group to which the process belongs.

As part of the login process. a login shell gets its real and group IDs from user's password record in /etc/password
user_name:x:1000:1000:user_name:/home/user_name:/bin/bash

3rd and 4th fields here are real USer ID an dgroup ID.

*Effective User ID and Effective Froup ID*
-------------------------------------------
Effective IDs and Supplementary group IDs are used determine the permissions granted to a process when it tries to
perform various system operations. 
Permissions access to resources such as files and IPC objects, which themselves are associated with some user and 
group ids detrmining to whom they belong.

A process with effective user ID 0 (user ID of root) has all of the privilages of the superuser.
This is privileged process.

Noramlly, effective user and group IDs have the same values as the corresponding real IDs, but there are way in 
which the effective IDs can assume different values.

*Set-user-ID and Set-Group-ID programs*
---------------------------------------

A set-user-ID and set-group-ID program allows a process to gain privileges it would not normally have, by setting the
preocess's effective user-ID to same value as the user ID of the executable file.

Every executable files had two special permission bits, the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits.

These permissions bits are set using chmod command.
# ls -l program
-rwxr-xr-x      1   root    root    302885  Dec 25  14:55 program
#chmod u+s program          Turn on set-user-ID permission bit
#chmod g+s program          Turn on set-group-ID permission bit
# ls -l program
-rwsr-sr-x      1   root    root    302885  Dec 25  14:55 program : x bits are changed to s
   -  - 
When set-user-ID program is run, the kernel sets the effective user ID of the process to be the same as the user ID
of executable file. Analogous results for set-group-ID.

*Saved set-User-ID and Saved Set-Group-ID*
------------------------------------------
The saved set-user-ID and seved set-group-ID are designed for use with set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs.

The values for saved set-user-ID and set-group-ID are copied from the corresponding effective IDs.

*File system User ID and File-system Group ID*
----------------------------------------------
File-sytem user ID an d file-system froup IDs are used to determine when performing file-system operations in Linux.
Normally file-system user ID an dgroup ID has same values as effective IDs. Whenever effecive IDs modifies file-system
IDs follows it.
There are scenarios when file-system IDs are diffrent from effective IDs. 

*Sumpplementary Group IDs*
--------------------------
The supplementary group IDs are set of aditional groups to which process belongs. New process inherits these IDs 
from parent.

*Retrieving and modifying real, effective and saved set IDs*
------------------------------------------------------------

#include <unistd.h>
uid_t getuid(void);     // Returns real user ID of calling process
uid_t geteuid(void);    // Returns effective user ID of calling process
gid_t getgid(void);     // Returns real group ID of calling process
gid_t getegid(void);    // Returns effective group ID of calling process

int setuid(uid_t uid);  // Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error
int setgid(gid_t gid);  // Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error

setuid() and getuid has following rules:
1) when unprevileged process calls setuid(), only effective uid is changed.It can be only changed to 
real used id or saved set-user-ID. 
2) When previleged process executes setuid() with non-zero value, real user ID, effective user ID and saved 
set-user-ID is set to argument value.
This is one-way operation, once user ID is changed to new value then it can not be set back 0.

Rules are valid for setgid() except, previlege of proces sis maintained.

int seteuid(uid_t euid);    // Returns 0 on success or -1 on error
int setegid(gid_t egid);    // Returns 0 on success or -1 on error

1) Unprevileged process can cahnge effective ID only to same value as the corresponding real or saved set ID.
2) A priviledged process can change effective ID to any value. As its effevtive ID changes its previlege goes away.

int setreuid(uid_t ruid, uid_t euid);   // Returns 0 on success or -1 on error
int setergid(gid_t rgid, gid_t egid);   // Returns 0 on success or -1 on error

int setresuid(uid_t ruid, uid_t euid, uid_t suid);
int setresgid(gid_t rgid, gid_t egid, gid_t sgid);

int getresuid(uid_t ruid, uid_t euid, uid_t suid);
int getersgid(gid_t rgid, gid_t egid, gid_t sgid);

int setfsuid(uid_t fsuid);  // Always returns the previous file system user ID
int setfsgid(gid_t fsgid);  // Always returns the previous file system group ID

int getgroups(int gidsetsize, gid_t grouplist[]); // REturns number of group IDs placed in grouplist or -1 on error
